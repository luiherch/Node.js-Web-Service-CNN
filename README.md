## Requirements

# Directories
Based on MVC architecture

## views
This folder contains all the views. I used a view engine in order to render dynamic content and send it to the user. For this project I used EJS for its simplicity and similarity with HTML and JS, but you can use other similar view engines such as Handlebars or Pug.

## controllers
Contains all the controllers to handle the requests.

It manages the different routes of the service, calling to the respective controller.
